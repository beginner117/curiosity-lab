## Matter-Wave BEC Interferometer in Extended Free Fall

**Goal:** Simulate a Mach–Zehnder light-pulse interferometer using a BEC during drop-tower microgravity.

### Features
- Phase scaling: φ ≈ k_eff · g · T²  
- Fringe contrast model with BEC expansion  
- Rotation & gradient sensitivity  
- Drop-tower compatible interrogation times (T) up to several seconds  

Extended free fall in the Bremen drop tower enables T² scaling and pico-Kelvin BEC coherence times.

## Optical BEC Formation with Painted Potentials 

**Goal:** Model evaporative cooling in a crossed optical dipole trap, including painted potentials.

### Features
- ODT trap depth & harmonic frequencies  
- Collision-rate-driven evaporation model  
- Time-averaged (painted) potential demonstration  
- Reaches BEC threshold with phase-space density (PSD) ≈ 1 on seconds scale  

 Models trap manipulation and evaporative cooling relevant to seconds-long Einstein-elevator cycles.

## Levitated Nanoparticle in Microgravity

**Goal:** Simulate a levitated 100-nm particle under optical trapping, parametric cooling, and microgravity drift.

### Features
- Langevin dynamics: x(t), v(t), PSD  
- Parametric feedback cooling  
- “Cool → release → drift → recapture” sequence  
- Demonstrates microgravity enhancement for long-coherence force sensing  

Demonstrates the core physics behind ultra-sensitive force sensors under microgravity (release-and-drift protocols).
