### 1. Levitated Particle in an Optical / Magnetic Trap
**Goal:** Simulate the center-of-mass dynamics of a levitated particle inside either:
- a stiffer optical trap, or  
- a softer, low-dissipation magnetic trap

### 2. Qubit–Oscillator Coupling (Jaynes–Cummings Toy Model)
**Goal:** Demonstrate excitation exchange between:
- a two-level system (qubit), and  
- a single mechanical mode (harmonic oscillator)

### 3. Gravity-Mediated Interaction Between Two Masses (Classical Toy Model)
**Goal:** Simulate two harmonically trapped masses interacting via a weak Newtonian gravitational potential:
