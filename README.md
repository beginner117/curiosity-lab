# Toy Models Repository

This repository contains a collection of **toy models** that explore concepts I find interesting and may want to pursue further in the future. The models are not intended to serve as exploratory prototypes and thought experiments to help me understand and test ideas.

## Purpose
- Provide a foundation for potential future research or projects.
- Maintain a structured archive of small-scale models for reference.

## Notes
- The comments and organization within these toy models were assisted by **AI tools**, which helped sort the code and improve clarity in documentation.
- Each directory corresponds to a specific concept or idea, and the models are meant to be lightweight and illustrative.

## Disclaimer
These toy models are exploratory in nature. They may contain simplifications or assumptions that make them unsuitable for direct application without further refinement.

### Future Directions
I plan to revisit and expand on these models as my interests evolve, potentially developing them into more detailed studies or practical implementations.
